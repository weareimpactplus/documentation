Release Notes


<Accordion title="Creative Optimizer Update Release Notes">

Dear Impact Plus users,

We’ve listened to your feedback and are happy to announce a few changes to the way that Creative Optimizer works that should improve your experience while continuing to provide an easily activated reduction lever with a significant impact on environmental performance without adjusting strategy or targeting.

### What’s changed?

| **What we heard** | **What we’ve changed** |
| --- | --- |
| A few presets in specific formats on platforms had some visual quality concerns | **Revised presets** for each format and platform to ensure **consistent quality of output** (see below for more detail) |
| Too many creative variants provided for each upload - hard to manage so many versions | Changed the output **file organisation into 3 folders** and reduced output to **3 creative outputs per aspect ratio** (see below for more details) |
| Filenames with suffixes were too long, making it hard to manage (char limits) and organise | **Removed the long suffixes** on output file names - detail on new output details can be found below |
| Low Audio Kbps in uploaded files prevented the video element from being optimized | Created a rule to **bypass low Audio kbps** while continuing to **optimize Video kbps** |

### New Output Details

Zip file downloaded via email: <<ORIGINAL FILE NAME >>_Date_Advertiser_Campaign-name_Platform name

Zip file structure: 

- 3 folders
    1. **Recommended – all devices - Platform name**
    2. **Max GHG Reduction – all devices - Platform name**
    3. CTV folder - Name dependent on which platforms they relate to:
        1. Programmatic platforms (DV360, Xandr, Google Ads, Youtube, TTD, Generic DSP) > **CTV specific – CTV – Platform name**
        2. Amazon DSP > **Prime video & Freevee specific - CTV - Amazon DSP**
        3. Tiktok > **Min GHG Reduction - all devices - Tiktok**

1. **Recommended spec** that will work across devices for a given platform. We do not envisage any concerns around video quality, regardless of the device or content of the video.
2. **Max GHG Reduction** folder provides more heavy optimization which may have a slightly noticeable impact on visual quality if using fast moving images, thin text (like subtitles or small print) or an extended color palette. This provides a stronger reduction than the recommended spec but we would advise a human review of the quality before deploying.
3. **CTV folder** provides appropriate specs for CTV devices due to their much larger size and quality needs. There is also a significant difference between minimum specs required by each platforms so we have captured that here to ensure all creatives are accepted.

The filenames within the folders no longer identify which set they’re in or their attributes as they did before to remove the long suffixes that were causing issue for some.

### Revised presets in Creative Optimizer

Full details for creative optimizer specs will be found in the documentation link found in the CO/ESP interface, or by visiting [docs.weareimpactplus.com/creativeoptimizer](http://docs.weareimpactplus.com/creativeoptimizer) directly.

The documentation changes will happen together with the new specifications going live so if you do not see the updated specs yet, it may not be live yet.

Let us know if you have any questions or feedback about Creative Optimizer in general or the specific changes through your CSM.

All the best,

The Impact Plus Team

## What’s New

### **Creative Weight Optimization Declaration**

Building on the success of our optimization declaration feature, we have added further capability to be able to declare creative weight optimizations.

This is important because creative weight is a significant contributor to overall GHG emissions and a major lever for reduction. Rather than using original file sizes which are not the true As creative weight isn't available in most of the platforms reporting APIsthat is used in platforms, we have built a model based on our hundreds of studies : where we have takenby taking the platform-compressed file weights of optimized and non-optimized creatives delivered to the user and broken it down by platform, by creative type, by format and by device, we to provide an accurate and a scalable model of reduction potential for optimized creatives.

With this feature, you will be able to easily identify where optimizations have been made and the resulting impact on your environmental performance!

For more information on how to use this and other optimization declaration features, please refer to the [online documentation](https://docs.weareimpactplus.com/campaignmanagement#optimization-declaration).

**SSO (Single Sign-On) Support**

We are happy to announce that we can now support Single Sign-On functionality with all major providers, including Microsoft ID Entra, Google, Okta and more.

To get started with an integration, please discuss your needs with your CSM, providing them details of your SSO provider and your internal administrator so that we can provide them the relevant details to activate SSO on your accounts.

## Additional Enhancements

### 

### **Supported Formats**

- Native Ads: We have added Native ads support for the Xandr platform

**Column Name order in reporting**

- To ease automated data ingestion in your reporting tools or eco-bidding algorithms, the order of the columns in our reportings is now fixed.We have rearranged the dimensions and metrics in reporting to group fields together more logically

We're committed to continuously improving your IMPACT+ experience. We believe these updates will help manage your sustainability goals with greater efficiency.

As always, feel free to reach out to our [support team](http://matilto:support@weareimpactplus.com/) if you have any questions.

<Accordion title="June Release Notes">

## **What’s New:**

### **Optimization Declaration:**

We've introduced a new feature to further improve the accuracy of your campaign's environmental impact, particularly in regards to efforts you have made to reduce your campaigns’ carbon footprint. It allows you to declare specific optimizations that can’t be automatically captured through our API connections to your buying platforms, such as:

- Wifi-only targeting
- Cellular targeting exclusion
- Lower carbon budget scheduling
- Creative & format selection

For further details including how to activate this on your campaign, please refer to our [online documentation](https://docs.weareimpactplus.com/campaignmanagement) 

## **Major Enhancements:**

### Reporting

- **Improved Reporting performance:** We’ve significantly improved the performance of various reporting features by over 50%. As an added bonus, it even reduces our electricity consumption! This has reduced the load/run time of the following evaluations:
    - Overview / Performance dashboards
    - All Report exports
    - Reduced / Avoided emissions

- **Reduced/Avoided Emissions Report UI:**  A lot of processing goes into creating these analysis so they can take some time depending on your settings. For this reason, we have modified the reports to:
    - **Run asynchronously:** You can now navigate away from the page while your report is loading and return when it is done!
    - **Be cancellable in progress:** If you realise that you forgot to incorporate a filter or need to change the dates, you can now stop the report from processing immediately and correct it. No more wasted time or electricity on unneeded reports.
    - **Notify you via e-mail when it is complete:** You will now receive an e-mail to let you know your analysis is complete so you can navigate back to the reduction section on your own schedule.

### Emissions Model improvement

- **Improved creative weight model** : Creative weights are now computed with higher precision, down to the specific format and platform rather than creative type. This model applies to all new creatives, and will be applied progressively to past creatives in the next few weeks.
- **Creative duration:** Exact creative durations are now pulled from DV360 and Youtube, for all new creatives and will be applied progressively to past creatives in the next few weeks. ****Other platforms would be added in the future.

## Additional Enhancements

### Creative Optimizer

- **Notification Email:** We’ve made it easier to go through your CO notification e-mails by adding a summary of what you submitted and what was optimized in the e-mail body so you know exactly which zip file you’re downloading!
- **File Support:** We now support videos without audio for specific formats that don’t require it

### Supported Platforms

- **Google Ads:** We have added Google Ads to our supported list of platforms we can connect via API. This is specifically for Display/Video activity and complements the support we already have in place for DV360. It also means that Youtube is covered whichever platform you buy it from.

We're committed to continuously improving your IMPACT+ experience. We believe these updates will help manage your sustainability goals with greater efficiency.

As always, feel free to reach out to our support team if you have any questions.

<Accordion title="March Release Notes">

## **What’s New:**

### **New colors for ESP:**

We’re excited to bring you the newest iteration of our ESP interface. We've updated the look & feel to reflect our brand colors and upgraded the filter functionality to make it more responsive and more intuitive so that you can get the environmental data you need more easily.
Along with these improvements to the UI, we also wanted to fill you in on what we've been working on behind the scenes to streamline your sustainability management needs.

### **Embodied Emissions are now available in reporting:**

A new metric has been added to the Report section called 'kgCO2eq of device embodied emissions' which allows you to identify the embodied emissions associated with activity. Please note that this figure is not included in any calculations or aggregated into any other fields as we usually focus on the 'Use' phase for analysis to represent the optimizable scope of activity.

### **Eco-bidding is open to all customers:**

Optimise your environmental impact alongside media performance by feeding our emissions data into your bidding algorithms. Speak to your CSM team to discuss how you could activate eco-bidding together with your agency, technology partner and DSP. 

### **Automate campaign management tasks via naming convention:**

Declare information about your campaigns/creatives directly via the creative/line item/activation names. This enables automated declaration of optimizations as well as providing further information to the model around video duration to provide the most accurate evaluation of your footprint without having to input data through the campaign management section. Your CSM can advise you on how this could benefit you based on the platforms you buy through and creative types you use.

As always, feel free to reach out to our support team if you have any questions.
